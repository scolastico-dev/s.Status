Hey, first a big thank you to all who supported the project with a github star. You guys are great. You really motivate to implement projects and not just let them lie on the side. Unfortunately I have to share the following information about this project: I am currently in my training to become an actual software developer however this project brings me several problems: On the one hand, I have used many ways here that I would no longer go to the other hand, I now know other projects that have taken more time and thought about this issue. Take a look at [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) for example. Therefore I close this repository and will archive it so that others can learn from my projects.
