## Small Notice
For all who think this repo is dead: A new rework in kotlin instead of java and a new ui in ~~nuxt~~/vue.js is on the way! Checkout the [kotlin-upgrade](https://github.com/scolastico-dev/s.Status/tree/kotlin-upgrade) branch for all new updates! ~~Release is planed for 01.05.2022 or earlier mid summer (sorry 4 that but im also bussy with other projects)!~~

It's finally happening! See forward for an update in the next day's! (written on 17.11.22./DD-MM-YY)

## Introduction
s.Status is a simple solution for monitoring pingable services such as database servers or http servers and providing a live status page. With the built in plugin system it is easy to add some functionalities like notification services.

## Pre-Release Notice
Hey, first of all it's cool that you're visiting the project before it's release. You're in luck, we're already in the prerelease phase with a functional beta version. You are welcome to use it and in general the most important functions should already work. But of course, as with all new applications, there may be bugs. It would be great if you either leave the "reportErrorsOnline" on in the settings, as this is how we find out about errors. Don't worry, your data is kept safe with us, we only use it for error analysis and rectification. If you want to support us even more, you can also create a github issue and explain to us in detail what you did that led to the error. If you want to know more about the privacy of the error report, you can view our privacy policy (GDPR) [here](https://go.scolasti.co/privacy). Apart from that, please excuse that some functions such as planned maintenance and plugin support are not yet implemented, but we will do it soon. It can also happen that our config changes several times during the prerelease phase, please always pay attention to the release notes because it explains, among other things, what to consider when updating.

## Installation & Usage
Because the application needs for the ping icmp package root privileges its recommended to use the docker installation which is more secure.

### Docker
**coming soon**

### Manual
Download from the latest release the `status-shadow.jar` and save it in a new folder where you want to execute the application. After that simply start the jar with the `java -jar status-shadow.jar` command. After the first start you will be asked to edit the generated configuration.
