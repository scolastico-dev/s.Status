Pre-Release Notice
==================

Hey, first of all it's cool that you're visiting the project before it's release.
You're in luck, we're already in the prerelease phase with a functional beta version.
You are welcome to use it and in general the most important functions should already work.
But of course, as with all new applications, there may be bugs.
It would be great if you either leave the "reportErrorsOnline" on in the settings,
as this is how we find out about errors. Don't worry, your data is kept safe with us, we
only use it for error analysis and rectification. If you want to support us even more,
you can also create a github issue and explain to us in detail what you did that led to
the error. If you want to know more about the privacy of the error report, you can view
our privacy policy (GDPR) here. Apart from that, please excuse that some functions such
as planned maintenance and plugin support are not yet implemented, but we will do it
soon. It can also happen that our config changes several times during the prerelease
phase, please always pay attention to the release notes because it explains, among other
things, what to consider when updating.
