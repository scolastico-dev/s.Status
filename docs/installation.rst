Installation
============

Download from the latest release (`GitHub`_) the ``s.Status-jar-with-dependencies.jar`` and save
it in a new folder where you want to execute the application. After that simply start the jar with
the ``java -jar s.Status-jar-with-dependencies.jar`` command. After the first start you will be
asked to edit the generated configuration.

You can also use the headless console client if you write arguments after the start command. For a
list of all commands you can use the ``help`` argument. The command for this would then look like
this: ``java -jar s.Status-jar-with-dependencies.jar help``
