## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to apparently report a security breach.
Depending on the severity, you can either open an issue on github ([here](https://github.com/scolastico-dev/s.Status/issues/new/choose))
or if it is a critical problem that shouldn't be published by the time
it is fixed, you can also send us an email to [support@scolasti.co](mailto:support@scolasti.co?subject=CRITICAL%20Security%20Issue&body=%23%23%23%20**Describe%20the%20bug**%0D%0AA%20clear%20and%20concise%20description%20of%20what%20the%20bug%20is.%0D%0A%0D%0A%23%23%23%20**To%20Reproduce**%0D%0ASteps%20to%20reproduce%20the%20behavior%3A%0D%0A1.%20Go%20to%20'...'%0D%0A2.%20Click%20on%20'....'%0D%0A3.%20Scroll%20down%20to%20'....'%0D%0A4.%20See%20error%0D%0A%0D%0A%23%23%23%20**Expected%20behavior**%0D%0AA%20clear%20and%20concise%20description%20of%20what%20you%20expected%20to%20happen.%0D%0A%0D%0A%23%23%23%20**Additional%20context**%0D%0AAdd%20any%20other%20context%20about%20the%20problem%20here.).
