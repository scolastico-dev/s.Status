  Sorry,
</h1>
<p>
  IN-DEV versions are not meant to use the web interface.
  If you want to use the web interface, you need to start the interface in a
  separate process.
</p>
<h3>(Recommended) How to start the <em>LIVE</em> web interface:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Install the latest LTS (currently 16.14.2) version Node.js and NPM on your machine (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">download</a>).</li>
  <li>Install the PNPM with the command "npm install -g pnpm"</li>
  <li>Go into the "website" folder in the root directory of the project.</li>
  <li>Download and install all dependencies with the command "pnpm i"</li>
  <li>Copy the "default.env" file as an ".env" file.</li>
  <li>If you are not using the default port for the api (the kotlin/java application) you need to change the port in the ".env" file.</li>
  <li>Start the server with the command "pnpm dev"</li>
  <li>Open the web interface in your browser: <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>How to build the web interface into the API:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Install the latest LTS (currently 16.14.2) version Node.js and NPM on your machine (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">download</a>).</li>
  <li>Install the PNPM with the command "npm install -g pnpm"</li>
  <li>Go into the "website" folder in the root directory of the project.</li>
  <li>Download and install all dependencies with the command "pnpm i"</li>
  <li>Copy the "live.env" file as an ".env" file.</li>
  <li>Build & Generate the static interface files with the command "pnpm build"</li>
  <li>The next steps should be done from the root directory of this project.</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the "website/dist/" folder into the "src/main/resources/web/" folder and overwrite the "index.html" file (this file) in it.</li>
  <li>Delete the "web.files/" folder.</li>
  <li>Start the API server which should now display the interface instead of this info.</li>
</ol>

  If you are wondering why the web interface is not by default available, the reason is that the web interface is meant to be freshly build by our CI jobs on every commit & release.
